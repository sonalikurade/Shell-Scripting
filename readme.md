Text files containing commands to execute by a shell are called shell scripts. In this, long and repetitive series of commands are compiled into a single script that can be stored and executed at any time, thereby reducing programming efforts. In shell scripts, repetitive work is largely avoided.

Shell scripts can be used for the following applications: 

- Automation of the code compiling process.
- Run a program or create an environment for programming.
- Complete batch processing and file manipulation.
- Integrate existing programs.
- Perform routine backups.
- Keeping an eye on a system.
- System administration's tasks
- Creating, maintaining, and implementing system boot scripts

**A sample shell script:**

echo "hello world"

**Run it as follows:**

$ bash hello.sh

# prints

hello world
